== Our Barn Board

This application is part of my final project for my Ruby On Rails Engineering Course.

The application is a project management tool for horse owners. It allows owners to update information on what their horses need each morning and evening, and allows others to view that information. Additionally, it allows a user to notify a horse's owner when the horse has been fed. 

I plan to use Redis and Sidekiq with Sidetiq to create background workers.

Currently WIP.
